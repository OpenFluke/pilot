# PILOT ðŸ§ ðŸ§ª

**Paragon Integration Launcher for Operations & Tutorials**

> The official testbed and orchestrator for running and exploring the latest experimental features in [Paragon](https://github.com/OpenFluke/paragon).

## ðŸš§ What is PILOT?

**PILOT** is a lightweight but powerful CLI tool built to **automate, test, and document** every capability being added to the Paragon neural network framework.

Think of it as the **"hello-world-on-steroids"** environment where each major Paragon feature is:

- Scripted.
- Verified.
- Explained through minimal working examples.
- Run on **native** or **WebGPU** targets.

Whether it's a new numeric type, a training experiment, a GPU optimization, or a network mutation strategy â€” **PILOT runs it first**.

## ðŸ§  What PILOT Does

PILOT exists to **stress test and document progress** in Paragon.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Focus Areas

- Run **static models** across multiple numeric types (`int8`, `float32`, etc.).
- Test **forward passes** on both **native CPU/GPU** and **browser/WebGPU**.
- Benchmark model behavior (e.g., inference speed, output fidelity).
- Script **experiments** for training, mutation, and replay.
- Showcase individual features (layer types, architecture evolution).
- Track accuracy, replay metrics, or experimental deviations.
